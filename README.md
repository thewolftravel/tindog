Tindog Project - Lesson 67
Tindog is a delightful Bootstrap project I developed during my journey through 🍺 the London App Brewery's Web Development course. Inspired by the idea of "Tinder, but for your fur babies". 🐕

Tech Stack
This project was brought to life using a simple yet effective tech stack, including:

HTML: Providing the structure for the web pages.
CSS: Styling and making the app visually appealing.
Bootstrap: Leveraging the power of this responsive web design framework for enhanced user experience.

Live Demo
You can experience Tindog live webpage by visiting the Live Demo: https://thewolftravel.github.io/tindog/

Feel free to explore the code, fork the project, and make your own creative contributions. 
If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Happy Tindogging! 🐶❤️🐾
